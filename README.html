</ul>

<hr />

<h1>Aim of the project -</h1>

<ul>
<li>Implement above mentioned compression algorithms and analyze time complexity, compression ratio, file type on which algorithms work, etc </li>
<li>The task of decompression will also be done along with compression to get the original data back.</li>
<li>Along with this the aim of project also to implement file compression algorithms involved for image file compression.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview of the project -</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The compression algorithms are classified into mainly two types - </p>

<ul>
<li>Lossless compression </li>
<li>Lossy compression</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Lossless compression</em> involves compression of data in which no information is lost in the process of data compression. Examples are Huffman Algorithm , LZ77 , LZ78, LZW ,Arithmetic coding , etc.   </p></li>
<li><p><em>Lossy compression</em> involves compression of data in which some information is lost in the process of data compression. Examples are discrete Cosine transform , quantization, etc</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Huffman Compression Algorithm -</h2>

<ul>
<li>Algorithm works by creating binary tree of nodes. The tree is created according to the frequency comparison of each character.</li>
<li>Thus we can say that most repeating character is present near to the root node and the least repeating character will act as a leaf in the binary tree. </li>
<li>Thus we can say that each character has can be represented as a unique bit pattern and thus this bit pattern can be stored and resulting storage of bits will be the compressed form of the original data.</li>
<li>Thus in order to decompress the data we need the tree to decode the data and get the original data back.</li>
<li><p>In this process no information or set of data is lost thus Huffman coding comes under the category of lossless compression algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>functions required are - basic file I/O , sorting algorithms </p></li>
<li>DATA STRUCTURE TO BE USED - tree, heap, and priority queue etc. </li>
</ul>

<h2>LZW Algorithm -</h2>

<ul>
<li>Its is a Dynamic Dictionary technique. Algorithm is used when there are large phrases and sentences to decode. </li>
<li>It works on reading a sequence then grouping of symbols and grouping symbols into strings and converting string into codes.</li>
<li>Make use of code table of suitable length and assign 0-255 indexes with the ASCII character set </li>
<li>Compression starts using code entries from 256 index.</li>
<li>More the similarity in strings more is the compression. </li>
<li>Thus in this process a dictionary gets created for representing the sequence of the codes. Thus while decoding we make use of this dictionary to decompress the data back.</li>
<li>High Compression ratio is obtained for large text files. </li>
</ul>

<h2>FURTHER TASK -</h2>

<ul>
<li>Will try to implement DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation) as a mean of lossy compression technique. This Algorithm is widely used in application based software like Whatsapp and also used in JPEG converters.</li>
</ul>
